## PR Title

## Why

PyTorch uses int_oo (IntInfinity) for unbounded constraints, which would make our current implementation crash

## How

- Update the type hint for `create_input_vars` to allow for optional upper bounds.
- Modify the logic to handle unbounded constraints by setting upper bounds to None when applicable.
- Add a new test case
