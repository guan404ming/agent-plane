Extremely Simplest and clearest
Fix Only One TODO

1.  find todo in relax folder and the predicted fix size should be appropriate for a single pull request
2.  If there is github pr or other branch try to fix this please find another one
3.  create branch for this fix
4.  resolve them
        - follow the coding style https://tvm.apache.org/docs/contribute/code_guide.html
        - try not add too much comment 
5.  add parameterized, concise and essential tests in right place and follow the convention
6.  if C/C++ files changed, run tvm-build in SKILL.md to build
7.  use tools in SKILL.md to verify

8.  commit only the needed changes with "git commit -n -m msg" and not co-author with claude, gemini or something else
9.  checkout to the main branch
10. return extremely simplest changelog but clear in bullet point and try follow the template

    example:
    ```
        ## PR Title

        ## Why 

        PyTorch uses int_oo (IntInfinity) for unbounded constraints, which would make our current implementation crash

        ## How

        - Update the type hint for `create_input_vars` to allow for optional upper bounds.
        - Modify the logic to handle unbounded constraints by setting upper bounds to None when applicable.
        - Add a new test case
    ```
